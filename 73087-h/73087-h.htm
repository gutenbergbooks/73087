<p>IN a series of papers in this periodical<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the present writer has
attempted to give the outlines of a theory of the constitution of atoms
and molecules by help of a certain application of the Quantum theory
of radiation to the theory of the nucleus atom. As the theory has been
made a subject of criticism, and as experimental evidence of importance
bearing on these questions has been obtained in the meantime, an
attempt will be made in this paper to consider some points more closely.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="1_General">§ 1. <i>General assumptions.</i></h2>
</div>


<p>According to the theory proposed by Sir Ernest Rutherford, in order
to account for the phenomena of scattering of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/16.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-rays, the
atom consists of a central positively charged nucleus surrounded by a
cluster of electrons. The nucleus is the seat of the essential part
of the mass of the atom, and has linear dimensions exceedingly small
compared with the distances apart of the electrons in the surrounding
cluster. From the results of experiments on scattering of alpha rays,
Rutherford concluded that the charge on the nucleus corresponds to a
number of electrons per atom approximately equal to half the atomic
weight. Concordant evidence from a large number of very different
phenomena has led to the more definite assumption that the number of
electrons per atom is exactly equal to the atomic number, <i>i.e</i>.,
the number of the corresponding element in the periodic table. This
view was first proposed by van den Broek<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. While the nucleus theory
has been of great utility in explaining many important properties of
the atom<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, on the other hand it is evident that it is impossible
by its aid to explain many other fundamental properties if we base
our considerations on the ordinary electrodynamical theory; but this
can hardly be considered as a valid objection at the present time. It
does not seem that there is any escape from the conclusion that it is
impossible to account for the phenomena of temperature radiation on
ordinary electrodynamics, and that the modification to be introduced
in this theory must be essentially equivalent with the assumptions
first used by Planck in the deduction of his radiation formula<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.
These assumptions are known as the Quantum theory. In my previous
paper it was attempted to apply the main principles of this theory by
introducing the following general assumptions:—</p>


<p class="hanging2">
A. An atomic system possesses a number of states in which no emission
of energy radiation takes place, even if the particles are in motion
relative to each other, and such an emission is to be expected on
ordinary electrodynamics. The states are denoted as the “stationary”
states of the system under consideration.</p>

<p class="hanging2">
B. Any emission or absorption of energy radiation will correspond to
the transition between two stationary states. The radiation emitted
during such a transition is homogeneous and the frequency <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.199ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/17.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu"> is
determined by the relation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 21.07ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
h \nu = A_1 - A_2
\qquad \text{(1)}
"></span>
where <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> is Planck’s constant and <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.685ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_1">,</span> and <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.685ex; height: 1.959ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_2">,</span> are the
energies of the system in the two stationary states.</p>

<p class="hanging2">
C. That the dynamical equilibrium of the systems in the stationary
states is governed by the ordinary laws of mechanics, while these laws
do not hold for the transition from one state to another.</p>

<p class="hanging2">
D. That the various possible stationary states of a system consisting
of an electron rotating round a positive nucleus are determined by the
relation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 18.221ex; height: 4.588ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
T = \frac{1}{2} nh \omega
\qquad \text{(2)}
"></span>
where <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.593ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/21.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T"> is the mean value of the kinetic energy of the system,
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.407ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\omega"> the frequency of rotation, and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> a whole number.</p>

<p>It will be seen that these assumptions are closely analogous to
those originally used by Planck about the emission of radiation in
quanta, and about the relation between the frequency of an atomic
resonator (of constant frequency) and its energy. It can be shown
that, for any system containing one electron rotating in a closed
orbit, the assumption C and the relation (2) will secure a connexion
between the frequency calculated by (1) and that to be expected from
ordinary electrodynamics, in the limit where the difference between
the frequency of the rotation of the electron in successive stationary
states is very small compared with the absolute value of the frequency
(see IV. p. 5). On the nucleus theory this occurs in the region of
very slow vibrations. If the orbit of the electron is circular, the
assumption D is equivalent to the condition that the angular momentum
of the system in the stationary states is an integral multiple of
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.416ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/24.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{h}{2 \pi}">.</span> The possible importance of the angular momentum
in the discussion of atomic systems in relation to Planck’s theory was
first pointed out by J. W. Nicholson<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>In paper I. it was shown that the above assumptions lead to an
interpretation of the Balmer formula for the hydrogen spectrum, and to
a determination of the Rydberg constant which was in close agreement
with the measurements. In these considerations it is not necessary to
make any assumption about the degree of excentricity of the orbit of
the electron, and we shall see in the next section that it cannot be
assumed that the orbit is always circular.</p>

<p>So far we have considered systems which contain only one electron,
but the general validity of the assumptions A and B seems strongly
supported by the fact that they offer a simple interpretation of the
general principle of combination of spectral lines (see IV. p. 2).
This principle was originally discovered by Ritz to hold for the
ordinary series spectra of the elements. It has recently acquired
increased interest by Fowler’s work on the series spectra of enhanced
lines emitted from many elements when subject to a powerful electric
discharge. Fowler showed that the principle of combination holds for
these spectra although the laws governing the numerical relation
between the lines at an important point (see <a href="#3_Spectra2">section 3</a>) differed from
those of the ordinary series spectra. There is also, as we shall
see in <a href="#4_The_high_frequency">section 4</a>, some indication that the principle holds for the
high frequency spectra revealed by interference in crystals. In this
connexion it may also be remarked that the assumption A recently has
obtained direct support by experiments of A. Einstein and J. W. de
Haas<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, who have succeeded in detecting and measuring a rotational
mechanical effect produced when an iron bar is magnetized. Their
results agree very closely with those to be expected on the assumption
that the magnetism of iron is due to rotating electrons, and as pointed
out by Einstein and Haas, these experiments therefore indicate very
strongly that electrons can rotate in atoms without emission of energy
radiation.</p>

<p>When we try to apply assumptions, analogous with C and D, to systems
containing more than one electron, we meet with difficulties, since in
this case the application of ordinary mechanics in general does not
lead to periodic orbits. An exception to this, however, occurs if the
electrons are arranged in rings and rotate in circular orbits, and from
simple considerations of analogy the following assumption was proposed
(see I. p. 24).</p>

<p class="hanging2">
E. In any atomic or molecular system consisting of positive nuclei and
electrons in which the nuclei are at rest relative to each other, and
the electrons move in circular orbits, the angular momentum of
each electron round the centre of its orbit will be equal to
<img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.416ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/24.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{h}{2 \pi}"> in the “normal” state of the system, <i>i.e</i>.
the state in which the total energy is a minimum.</p>

<p>It was shown that in a number of different cases this assumption
led to results in approximate agreement with experimental facts. In
general, no stable configuration in which the electrons rotate in
circular orbits can exist if the problem of stability is discussed on
ordinary mechanics. This is no objection, however, since it is assumed
already that the mechanics do not hold for the transition between two
stationary states. Simple considerations led to the following condition
of stability.</p>

<p class="hanging2">
F. A configuration satisfying the condition E is stable if the total
energy of the system is less than in any neighbouring configuration
satisfying the same condition of angular momentum of the electrons.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, the foundation for the hypothesis E was sought
in analogy with the simple system consisting of one electron and one
nucleus. Additional support, however, was obtained from a closer
consideration of the formation of the systems. It was shown how simple
processes could be imagined by which the confluence of different rings
of electrons could be effected without any change in the angular
momentum of the electrons, if the angular momentum of each electron
before the process was the same. Such considerations led to a theory of
formation of molecules.</p>

<p>It must be emphasized that only in the case of circular orbits has
the angular momentum any connexion with the principles of the Quantum
theory. If, therefore, the application of ordinary mechanics to the
stationary states of the system does not lead to strictly circular
orbits, the assumption E cannot be applied. This case occurs if
we consider configurations in which the electrons are arranged in
different rings which do not rotate with the same frequency. Such
configurations, however, are apparently necessary in order to explain
many characteristic properties of the atoms. In my previous papers
an attempt was made in certain cases to overcome this difficulty by
assuming, that if a very small alteration of the forces would make
circular orbits possible on ordinary mechanics, the configuration and
energy of the actual system would only differ very little from that
calculated for the altered system. It will be seen that this assumption
is most intimately connected with the hypothesis F on the stability
of the configurations. Such considerations were used to explain the
general appearance of the Rydberg constant in the spectra of the
elements, and were also applied in discussing possible configurations
of the electrons in the atoms suggested by the observed chemical
properties. These calculations have been criticised by Nicholson<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>,
who has attempted to show that the configurations chosen for the
electrons in the atoms are inconsistent with the main principles of the
theory, and has also attempted to prove the impossibility of accounting
for other spectra by help of assumptions similar to those used in the
interpretation of the hydrogen spectrum.</p>

<p>Although I am quite ready to admit that these points involve great
and unsolved difficulties, I am unable to agree with Nicholson’s
conclusions. In the first place, his calculations rest upon a
particular application to non-circular orbits of the principle of
constancy of angular momentum for each electron, which it does not seem
possible to justify either on the Quantum theory or on the ordinary
mechanics, and which has no direct connexion with the assumptions
used in my papers. It has not been proved that the configurations
proposed are inconsistent with the assumption C. But even if it were
possible to prove that the unrestricted use of ordinary mechanics to
the stationary states is inconsistent with the configurations of the
electrons, apparently necessary to explain the observed properties of
the elements, this would not constitute a serious objection to the
deductions in my papers. It must be remarked that all the applications
of ordinary mechanics are essentially connected with the assumption
of periodic orbits. As far as the applications are concerned, the
first part of the assumption C might just as well have been given the
following more cautious form:—</p>

<p>“The relation between the frequency and energy of the particles in the
stationary states can be determined by means of the ordinary laws of
mechanics if these laws lead to periodic orbits.”</p>

<p>The possible necessity for an alteration of this kind in assumption C
may perhaps not seem unlikely when it is remembered that the laws of
mechanics are only known to hold for certain mean values of the motion
of the electrons. In this connexion it should also be remarked that
when considering periodic orbits only mean values are essential (comp.
I. p. 7). The preliminary and tentative character of the formulation
of the general assumptions cannot be too strongly emphasized, and
admittedly they are made to suit certain simple applications. For
example, it has been already shown in paper IV. that the assumption B
needs modification in order to account for the effect of a magnetic
field on spectral lines. In the following sections some of the recent
experimental evidence on line spectra and characteristic Röntgen rays
will be considered, and I shall endeavour to show that it seems to give
strong support to the main principles of the theory.</p>

<p>In the former papers it was shown that the general assumptions led to
the following formula for the spectrum emitted by an electron rotating
round a positive nucleus

the nucleus and the electron respectively. The frequency of rotation
and the major axis of the relative orbit of the particles in the

The energy necessary to remove the electron to infinite distance from
the nucleus is

This expression is also equal to the mean value of the kinetic energy
of the system. Since <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 5.044ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/29.svg" alt=" " data-tex="-W_{n}"> is equal to the total energy <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.844ex; height: 1.977ex;" src="images/30.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A_n"> of

\qquad \text{(6)}
"></span>
If we compare (6) with the relation (1), we see that the connexion with
ordinary mechanics in the region of slow vibration, mentioned in the
<a href="#1_General">former section</a>, is satisfied.</p>

<p>Putting <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.157ex; height: 1.731ex;" src="images/31.svg" alt=" " data-tex="N = 1"> in (3) we get the ordinary series spectrum of
hydrogen. Putting <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.157ex; height: 1.731ex;" src="images/32.svg" alt=" " data-tex="N = 2"> we get a spectrum which, on the theory,
should be expected to be emitted by an electron rotating round a helium
nucleus. The formula is found very closely to represent some series
of lines observed by Fowler<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and Evans<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. These series correspond
to <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 6.493ex; height: 1.844ex;" src="images/33.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n_1 = 3"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 6.493ex; height: 1.871ex;" src="images/34.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n_1 = 4"><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. The theoretical value for the
ratio between the second factor in (3) for this spectrum and for the
hydrogen spectrum is 1.000409; the value calculated from Fowler’s
measurements is 1.000408<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. Some of the lines under consideration
have been observed earlier in star spectra, and have been ascribed
to hydrogen not only on account of the close numerical relation with
the lines of the Balmer series, but also on account of the fact that
the lines observed, together with the lines of the Balmer series,
constitutes a spectrum which shows a marked analogy with the spectra of
the alkali metals. This analogy, however, has been completely disturbed
by Fowler’s and Evans’ observations, that the two new series contain
twice as many lines as is to be expected on this analogy. In addition,
Evans has succeeded in obtaining the lines in such pure helium that no
trace of the ordinary hydrogen lines could be observed<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. The great
difference between the conditions for the production of the Balmer
series and the series under consideration is also brought out very
strikingly by some recent experiments of Rau<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> on the minimum voltage
necessary for the production of spectral lines. While about 13 volts
was sufficient to excite the lines of the Balmer series, about 80 volts
was found necessary to excite the other series. These values agree
closely with the values calculated from the assumption E for the
energies necessary to remove the electron from the hydrogen atom and to
remove both electrons from the helium atom, viz. 13.6 and 81.3 volts
respectively. It has recently been argued<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> that the lines are not so
sharp as should be expected from the atomic weight of helium on Lord
Rayleigh’s theory of the width of spectral lines. This might, however,
be explained by the fact that the systems emitting the spectrum, in
contrast to those emitting the hydrogen spectrum, are supposed to carry
an excess positive charge, and therefore must be expected to acquire
great velocities in the electric field in the discharge-tube.</p>

<p>In paper IV. an attempt was made on the basis of the present theory to
explain the characteristic effect of an electric field on the hydrogen
spectrum recently discovered by Stark. This author observed that if
luminous hydrogen is placed in an intense electric field, each of the
lines of the Balmer series is split up into a number of homogeneous
components. These components are situated symmetrically with regard to
the original lines, and their distance apart is proportional to the
intensity of the external electric field. By spectroscopic observation
in a direction perpendicular to the field, the components are linearly
polarized, some parallel and some perpendicular to the field. Further
experiments have shown that the phenomenon is even more complex than
was at first expected. By applying greater dispersion, the number of
components observed has been greatly increased, and the numbers as well
as the intensities of the components are found to vary in a complex
manner from line to line<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. Although the present development of the
theory does not allow us to account in detail for the observations,
it seems that the considerations in paper IV. offer a simple
interpretation of several characteristic features of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>The calculation can be made considerably simpler than in the former
paper by an application of Hamilton’s principle. Consider a particle
moving in a closed orbit in a stationary field. Let <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.407ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\omega"> be the
frequency of revolution, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.593ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/21.svg" alt=" " data-tex="T"> the mean value of the kinetic energy
during the revolution, and <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/35.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W"> the mean value of the sum of the
kinetic energy and the potential energy of the particle relative to the
stationary field. We have then for a small arbitrary variation of the
orbit
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 25.408ex; height: 5.428ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\delta W = -2 \omega  \delta \left(\frac{T}{ \omega }\right)
\qquad \text{(7)}
"></span>
This equation was used in paper IV. to prove the equivalence of the
formulæ (2) and (6) for any system governed by ordinary mechanics. The
equation (7) further shows that if the relations (2) and (6) hold for a
system of orbits, they will hold also for any small variation of these
orbits for which the value of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/35.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W"> is unaltered. If a hydrogen atom in
one of its stationary states is placed in an external electric field
and the electron rotates in a closed orbit, we shall therefore expect
that <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.371ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/35.svg" alt=" " data-tex="W"> is not altered by the introduction of the atom in the field,
and that the only variation of the total energy of the system will be
due to the variation of the mean value of the potential energy relative
to the external field.</p>

<p>In the former paper it was pointed out that the orbit of the electron
will be deformed by the external field. This deformation will in course
of time be considerable even if the external electric force is very
small compared with the force of attraction between the particles. The
orbit of the electron may at any moment be considered as an ellipse
with the nucleus in the focus, and the length of the major axis will
approximately remain constant, but the effect of the field will consist
in a gradual variation of the direction of the major axis as well as
the excentricity of the orbit. A detailed investigation of the very
complicated motion of the electron was not attempted, but it was simply
pointed out that the problem allows of two stationary orbits of the
electron, and that these may be taken as representing two possible
stationary states. In these orbits the excentricity is equal to 1,
and the major axis parallel to the external force; the orbits simply
consisting of a straight line through the nucleus parallel to the axis
of the field, one on each side of it. It can very simply be shown that
the mean value of the potential energy relative to the field for these
rectilinear orbits is equal to <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 7.867ex; height: 4.586ex;" src="images/36.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\pm \dfrac{3}{2} aeE">,</span> where <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.729ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/37.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E"> is

the two signs correspond to orbits in which the direction of the major
axis from the nucleus is the same or opposite to that of the electric
force respectively. Using the formulæ (4) and (5) and neglecting
the mass of the electron compared with that of the nucleus, we get,
therefore, for the energy of the system in the two states
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.679ex; width: 46.224ex; height: 5.112ex;" src="images/8.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

"></span>
respectively. This expression is the same as that deduced in paper
IV. by an application of (6) to the expressions for the energy and
frequency of the system. Applying the relation (1) and using the same
arguments as in paper IV. p. 10, we are therefore led to expect that
the hydrogen spectrum in an electric field will contain two components
polarized parallel to the field and of a frequency given by

<p>Considering the difficulties of accurate measurement of the quantities
involved, it will be seen that the agreement with regard to the
variation of the frequency differences from line to line is very good.
The fact that all the observed values are a little smaller than the
calculated may be due to a slight over-estimate of the intensity of
the fields used in the experiments (see Stark, <i>loc. cit</i>. pp. 38
and 118). Besides the two strong outer components polarized parallel
to the field, Stark’s experiments have revealed a large number of
inner weaker components polarized in the same way, and also a number
of components polarized perpendicular to the field. This complexity
of the phenomenon, however, cannot be considered as inconsistent with
the theory. The above simple calculations deal only with the two
extreme cases, and we may expect to find a number of stationary states
corresponding to orbits of smaller excentricity. In a discussion of
such non-periodic orbits, however, the general principles applied are
no longer sufficient guidance.</p>

<p>Apart from the agreement with the calculations, Stark’s experiments
seem to give strong support to the interpretation of the origin of
the two outer components. It was found that the two outer components
have not always equal intensities; when the spectrum is produced by
positive rays, it was found that the component of highest frequency
is the stronger if the rays travel against the electric field, while
if it travels in the direction of the field the component of smallest
frequency is the stronger (<i>loc. cit</i>. p. 40). This indicates that
the components are produced independently of each other—a result to be
expected if they correspond to quite different orbits of the electron.
That the orbit of the electron in general need not be circular is
also very strongly indicated by the observation that the hydrogen
lines emitted from positive rays under certain conditions are partly
polarized without the presence of a strong external field (<i>loc.
cit</i>. p. 12). This polarization, as well as the observed intensity
differences of the two components, would be explained if we can assume
that for some reason, when the atom is in rapid motion, there is a
greater probability for the orbit of the electron to lie behind the
nucleus rather than in front of it.</p>

<p>On the present theory, this indicates that the system which emits the
spectrum possesses a number of series of stationary states for which
the energy in the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n">th state in the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.02ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/48.svg" alt=" " data-tex="r">th series is given by (see
IV. p. 6)

"></span>
where <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.719ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/49.svg" alt=" " data-tex="C"> is an arbitrary constant, the same for the whole system of
stationary states. The first factor in the second term is equal to the
expression (5) if <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.157ex; height: 1.731ex;" src="images/31.svg" alt=" " data-tex="N = 1">.</span></p>

<p>In the present state of the theory it is not possible to account in
detail for the formula (13), but it was pointed out in my previous
papers that a simple interpretation can be given of the fact that in
every series <img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 4.466ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/50.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\phi(n)"> approaches unity for large values of <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n">.</span> It
was assumed that in the stationary states corresponding to such values
of <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n">,</span> one of the electrons in the atom moves at a distance from the
nucleus large compared with the distance of the other electrons. If
the atom is neutral, the outer electron will be subject to very nearly
the same forces as the electron in the hydrogen atom, and the formula
(13) indicates the presence of a number of series of stationary states
of the atom in which the configuration of the inner electrons is very
nearly the same for all states in one series, while the configuration
of the outer electron changes from state to state in the series
approximately in the same way as the electron in the hydrogen atom.
From the considerations in the former sections it will therefore appear
that the frequency calculated from the relations (1) and (13) for the
radiation emitted during the transition between successive stationary
states within each series will approach that to be expected on ordinary
electrodynamics in the region of slow vibrations<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<p>From (13) it follows that for high values of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> the configuration
of the inner electrons possesses the same energy in all the series
of stationary states corresponding to the same spectrum (11). The
different series of stationary states must therefore correspond to
different types of orbits of the outer electron, involving different
relations between energy and frequency. In order to fix our ideas,
let us for a moment consider the helium atom. This atom contains only
two electrons, and in the previous papers it was assumed that in the
normal state of the atom the electrons rotate in a circular ring round
a nucleus. Now the helium spectrum contains two complete systems of
series given by formulæ of the type (11) and the measurements of Rau
mentioned below indicate that the configuration of the inner electron
in the two corresponding systems of stationary states possesses the
same energy. A simple assumption is therefore that in one of the
two systems the orbit of the electron is circular and in the other
very flat. For high values of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> the inner electron in the two
configurations will act on the outer electron very nearly as a ring
of uniformly distributed charge with the nucleus in the centre or
as a line charge extending from the nucleus, respectively. In both
cases several different types of orbit for the outer electron present
themselves, for instance, circular orbits perpendicular to the axis of
the system or very flat orbits parallel to this axis. The different
configurations of the inner electrons might be due to different ways
of removing the electron from the neutral atom: thus, if it is removed
by impact perpendicular to the plane of the ring, we might expect the
orbit of the remaining electron to be circular, if it is removed by an
impact in the plane of the ring we might expect the orbit to be flat.
Such considerations may offer a simple explanation of the fact that in
contrast with the helium spectrum the lithium spectrum contains only
one system of series of the type (11). The neutral lithium atom contains
three electrons, and according to the configuration proposed in paper
II. the two electrons move in an inner ring and the other electron in
an outer orbit; for such a configuration we should expect that the
mode of removal of the outer electron would be of no influence on the
configuration of the inner electrons. It is unnecessary to point out
the hypothetical nature of these considerations, but the intention
is only to show that it does not seem impossible to obtain simple
interpretations of the spectra observed on the general principles of
the theory. However, in a quantitative comparison with the measurements
we meet with the difficulties mentioned in the <a href="#1_General">first section</a> of
applying assumptions analogous with <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.719ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/49.svg" alt=" " data-tex="C"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.873ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/51.svg" alt=" " data-tex="D"> to systems for
which ordinary mechanics do not lead to periodic orbits.</p>

<p>The above interpretation of the formulæ (11) and (12) has recently
obtained very strong support by Fowler’s work on series of enhanced
lines on spark spectra<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. Fowler showed that the frequency of the
lines in these spectra, as of the lines in the ordinary spectra, can
be represented by the formula (11). The only difference is that the
Rydberg constant <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/46.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> in (12) is replaced by a constant <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 3.143ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/52.svg" alt=" " data-tex="4K">.</span> It
will be seen that this is just what we should expect on the present
theory if the spectra are emitted by atoms which have lost two
electrons and are regaining one of them. In this case, the outer
electron will rotate round a system of double charge, and we must
assume that in the stationary states it will have configurations
approximately the same as an electron rotating round a helium nucleus.
This view seems in conformity with the general evidence as to the
conditions of the excitation of the ordinary spectra and the spectra of
enhanced lines. From Fowler’s results, it will appear that the helium
spectrum given by (3) for <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.157ex; height: 1.731ex;" src="images/32.svg" alt=" " data-tex="N = 2"> has exactly the same relation
to the spectra of enhanced lines of other elements as the hydrogen
spectrum has to the ordinary spectra. It may be expected that it will
be possible to observe spectra of a new class corresponding to a loss
of 3 electrons from the atom, and in which the Rydberg constant <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/46.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">
is replaced by <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 3.143ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/53.svg" alt=" " data-tex="9K">.</span> No definite evidence, however, has so far been
obtained of the existence of such spectra<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p>Additional evidence of the essential validity of the interpretation
of formula (13) seems also to be derived from the result of Stark’s
experiments on the effect of electric fields on spectral lines. For
other spectra, this effect is even more complex than for the hydrogen
spectrum, in some cases not only are a great number of components
observed, but the components are generally not symmetrical with regard
to the original line, and their distance apart varies from line to line
in the same series in a far more irregular way than for the hydrogen
lines<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. Without attempting to account in detail for any of the
electrical effects observed, we shall see that a simple interpretation
can be given of the general way in which the magnitude of the effect
varies from series to series.</p>

<p>In the theory of the electrical effect on the hydrogen spectrum given
in the <a href="#2_Spectra">former section</a>, it was supposed that this effect was due to an
alteration of the energy of the systems in the external field, and
that this alteration was intimately connected with a considerable
deformation of the orbit of the electron. The possibility of this
deformation is due to the fact that without the external field every
elliptical orbit of the electron in the hydrogen atom is stationary.
This condition will only be strictly satisfied if the forces which act
upon the electron vary exactly as the inverse square of the distance
from the nucleus, but this will not be the case for the outer electron
in an atom containing more than one electron. It was pointed out in
paper IV. that the deviation of the function <img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 4.466ex; height: 2.262ex;" src="images/54.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\phi (n)"> from unity
gives us an estimate for the deviation of the forces from the inverse
square, and that on the theory we can only expect a Stark effect of the
same order of magnitude as for the hydrogen lines for those series in
which <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.348ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/47.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\phi"> differs very little from unity.</p>

<p>This conclusion was consistent with Stark’s original measurements of
the electric effect on the different series in the helium spectrum,
and it has since been found to be in complete agreement with the later
measurements for a great number of other spectral series. An electric
effect of the same order of magnitude as that for hydrogen lines has
been observed only for the lines in the two diffuse series of the
helium spectrum and the diffuse series of lithium. This corresponds
to the observation that for these three series <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.348ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/47.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\phi"> is very much
nearer to unity than for any other series; even for <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.506ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/55.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n = 5"> the
deviation of <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.348ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/47.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\phi"> from 1 is less than one part in a thousand. The
distance between the outer components for all three series is smaller
than that observed for the hydrogen line corresponding to the same
value of <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n">,</span> but the ratio between this distance and that of the
hydrogen lines approaches rapidly to unity as <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> increases. This is
just what would be expected on the above considerations. The series for
which the effect, although much smaller, comes next in magnitude to
the three series mentioned, is the principal single line series in the
helium spectrum. This corresponds to the fact that the deviation of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.348ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/47.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\phi"> from unity, although several times greater than for the three
first series, is much smaller for this series than for any other of the
series examined by Stark. For all the other series the effect was very
small, and in most cases even difficult of detection.</p>

<p>Quite apart from the question of the detailed theoretical
interpretation of the formula (13), it seems that it may be possible
to test the validity of this formula by direct measurements of the
minimum voltages necessary to produce spectral lines. Such measurements
have recently been made by Rau<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> for the lines in the ordinary
helium spectrum. This author found that the different lines within
each series appeared for slightly different voltages, higher voltages
being necessary to produce the lines corresponding to higher values of
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n">,</span> and he pointed out that the differences between the voltages
observed were of the magnitude to be expected from the differences in
the energies of the different stationary states calculated by (13). In
addition Rau found that the lines corresponding to high values of n
appeared for very nearly the same voltages for all the different series
in both helium spectra. The absolute values for the voltages could
not be determined very accurately with the experimental arrangement,
but apparently nearly 30 volts was necessary to produce the lines
corresponding to high values of <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n">.</span> This agrees very closely with
the value calculated on the present theory for the energy necessary
to remove one electron from the helium atom, viz., 29.3 volts. On
the other hand, the later value is considerably larger than the
ionization potential in helium (20.5 volts) measured directly by Franck
and Hertz<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. This apparent disagreement, however, may possibly be
explained by the assumption, that the ionization potential measured
does not correspond to the removal of the electron from the atom but
only to a transition from the normal state of the atom to some other
stationary state where the one electron rotates outside the other, and
that the ionization observed is produced by the radiation emitted when
the electron falls back to its original position. This radiation would
be of a sufficiently high frequency to ionize any impurity which may
be present in the helium gas, and also to liberate electrons from the
metal part of the apparatus. The frequency of the radiation would be
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 18.91ex; height: 4.638ex;" src="images/56.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{20.5}{300}\dfrac{e}{h} = 5.0 \cdot 10^{15}">,</span> which is of the
same order of magnitude as the characteristic frequency calculated from
experiments on dispersion in helium, viz., <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 8.576ex; height: 2.005ex;" src="images/57.svg" alt=" " data-tex="5.0 \cdot 10^{15}"><a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<p>Similar considerations may possibly apply also to the recent remarkable
experiments of Franck and Hertz on ionization in mercury vapour<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.
These experiments show strikingly that an electron does not lose energy
by collision with a mercury atom if its energy is smaller than a
certain value corresponding to 4.9 volts, but as soon as the energy is
equal to this value the electron has a great probability of losing all
its energy by impact with the atom. It was further shown that the atom,
as the result of such an impact, emits a radiation consisting only of
the ultraviolet mercury line of wave-length 2536, and it was pointed
out that if the frequency of this line is multiplied by Planck’s
constant, we obtain a value which, within the limit of experimental
error, is equal to the energy acquired by an electron by a fall through
a potential difference of 4.9 volts. Franck and Hertz assume that 4.9
volts corresponds to the energy necessary to remove an electron from
the mercury atom, but it seems that their experiments may possibly be
consistent with the assumption that this voltage corresponds only to
the transition from the normal state to some other stationary state
of the neutral atom. On the present theory we should expect that the
value for the energy necessary to remove an electron from the mercury
atom could be calculated from the limit of the single line series of
Paschen, 1850, 1403, 1269<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. For since mercury vapour absorbs light
of wave-length 1850<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>, the lines of this series as well as the line
2536 must correspond to a transition from the normal state of the atom
to other stationary states of the neutral atom (see I. p. 16). Such a
calculation gives 10.5 volts for the ionization potential instead of
4.9 volts<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. If the above considerations are correct it will be seen
that Franck and Hertz’s measurements give very strong support to the
theory considered in this paper. If, on the other hand, the ionization
potential of mercury should prove to be as low as assumed by Franck
and Hertz, it would constitute a serious difficulty for the above
interpretation of the Rydberg constant, at any rate for the mercury
spectrum, since this spectrum contains lines of greater frequency than
the line 2536.</p>

<p>It will be remarked that it is assumed that all the spectra considered
in this section are essentially connected with the displacement
of a single electron. This assumption—which is in contrast to
the assumptions used by Nicholson in his criticism of the present
theory—does not only seem supported by the measurements of the energy
necessary to produce the spectra, but it is also strongly advocated
by general reasons if we base our considerations on the assumption
of stationary states. Thus it may happen that the atom loses several
electrons by a violent impact, but the probability that the electrons
will be removed to exactly the same distance from the nucleus or will
fall back into the atom again at exactly the same time would appear
to be very small. For molecules, <i>i. e</i>. systems containing more
than one nucleus, we have further to take into consideration that if
the greater part of the electrons are removed there is nothing to keep
the nuclei together, and that we must assume that the molecules in such
cases will split up into single atoms (comp. III. p. 2).</p>

<p>In paper II. it was shown that the assumption E led to an estimate of
the energy necessary to remove an electron from the innermost ring
of an atom which was in approximate agreement with Whiddington’s
measurements of the minimum kinetic energy of cathode rays required to
produce the characteristic Röntgen radiation of the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/46.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> type. The
value calculated for this energy was equal to the expression (5) if
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.506ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n = 1">.</span> In the calculation the repulsion from the other electrons in
the ring was neglected. This must result in making the value a little
too large, but on account of the complexity of the problem no attempt
at that time was made to obtain a more exact determination of the
energy.</p>

<p>These considerations have obtained strong support through Moseley’s
important researches on the high frequency spectra of the
elements<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. Moseley found that the frequency of the strongest lines
in these spectra varied in a remarkably simple way with the atomic
number of the corresponding element. For the strongest line in the
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/46.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> radiation he found that the frequency for a great number of
elements was represented with considerable accuracy by the empirical
formula
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 26.23ex; height: 2.78ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

\qquad \text{(14)}
"></span>
where <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/46.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> is the Rydberg constant in the hydrogen spectrum. It
will be seen that this result is in approximate agreement with the
calculation mentioned above if we assume that the radiation is emitted
as a quantum <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.502ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/59.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h \nu">.</span></p>

<p>Moseley pointed out the analogy between the formula (14) and
the formula (3) in <a href="#2_Spectra">section 2</a>, and remarked that the constant
<img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 2.127ex; height: 4.586ex;" src="images/60.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{3}{4}"> was equal to the last factor in this formula, if we
put <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 6.493ex; height: 1.846ex;" src="images/61.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n_1 = 1"> and <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 6.493ex; height: 1.846ex;" src="images/62.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n_2 = 2">.</span> He therefore proposed the explanation
of the formula (14), that the line was emitted during a transition of
the innermost ring between two states in which the angular momentum of
each electron was equal to <img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 4.548ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/63.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2 \dfrac{h}{2 \pi}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.416ex; height: 4.676ex;" src="images/64.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{h}{2
\pi}"> respectively. From the replacement of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 3.119ex; height: 1.887ex;" src="images/65.svg" alt=" " data-tex="N^{2}"> by <img style="vertical-align: -0.566ex; width: 8.151ex; height: 2.452ex;" src="images/66.svg" alt=" " data-tex="(N—1)^{2}">
he deduced that the number of electrons in the ring was equal to
4. This view, however, can hardly be maintained. The approximate
agreement mentioned above with Whiddington’s measurements for the
energy necessary to produce the characteristic radiation indicates
very strongly that the spectrum is due to a displacement of a single
electron, and not to a whole ring. In the latter case the energy should
be several times larger. It is also pointed out by Nicholson<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> that
Moseley’s explanation would imply the emission of several quanta at
the same time; but this assumption is apparently not necessitated for
the explanation of other phenomena. At present it seems impossible to
obtain a detailed interpretation of Moseley’s results, but much light
seems to be thrown on the whole problem by some recent interesting
considerations by W. Kossel<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<p class="space-below2">
Kossel takes the view of the nucleus atom and assumes that the
electrons are arranged in rings, the one outside the other. As in the
present theory, it is assumed that any radiation emitted from the atom
is due to a transition of the system between two steady states, and
that the frequency of the radiation is determined by the relation (1).
He considers now the radiation which results from the removal of an
electron from one of the rings, assuming that the radiation is emitted
when the atom settles down in its original state. The latter process
may take place in different ways. The vacant place in the ring may be
taken by an electron coming directly from outside the whole system,
but it may also be taken by an electron jumping from one of the outer
rings. In the latter case a vacant place will be left in that ring to
be replaced in turn by another electron, etc. For the sake of brevity,
we shall refer to the innermost ring as ring 1, the next one as ring
2, and so on. Kossel now assumes that the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/46.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> radiation results from
the removal of an electron from ring 1, and makes the interesting
suggestion that the line denoted by Moseley as <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.132ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/67.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K_{\alpha}">
corresponds to the radiation emitted when an electron jumps from ring
2 to ring 1, and that the line <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.014ex; height: 2.195ex;" src="images/68.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K_{\beta}">,</span> corresponds to a jump
from ring 3 to ring 1. On this view, we should expect that the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/46.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K">
radiation consists of as many lines as there are rings in the atom,
the lines forming a series of rapidly increasing intensities. For the
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.541ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/69.svg" alt=" " data-tex="L"> radiation, Kossel makes assumptions analogous to those for the
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/46.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> radiation, with the distinction that the radiation is ascribed to
the removal of an electron from ring 2 instead of ring 1. A possible
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.378ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/27.svg" alt=" " data-tex="M"> radiation is ascribed to ring 3, and so on. The interest of these
considerations is that they lead to the prediction of some simple
relations between the frequencies <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.199ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/17.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu"> of the different lines. Thus
it follows as an immediate consequence of the assumption used that we
must have
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.395ex; width: 42.75ex; height: 5.921ex;" src="images/15.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\begin{array}{1}
\nu_{K_\beta} - \nu_{K_\alpha} = \nu_{L_\alpha}\\
\qquad\qquad\qquad
\nu_{K_\gamma} - \nu_{K_\beta} =
\nu_{L_\beta} - \nu_{L_\alpha} = \nu_{M_\alpha}.
\end{array}
"></span>
It will be seen that these relations correspond exactly to the ordinary
principle of combination of spectral lines. By using Moseley’s
measurements for <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.132ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/67.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K_{\alpha}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.014ex; height: 2.195ex;" src="images/68.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K_{\beta}"> and extrapolating
for the values of <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 2.752ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/70.svg" alt=" " data-tex="L_{\alpha}"> by the help of Moseley’s. empirical
formula, Kossel showed that the first relation was closely satisfied
for the elements from calcium to zinc. Recently T. Malmer<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> has
measured the wave-length of <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.132ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/67.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K_{\alpha}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.65ex; width: 3.014ex; height: 2.195ex;" src="images/68.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K_{\beta}"> for
a number of elements of higher atomic weight, and it is therefore
possible to test the relation over a wider range and without
extrapolation. The table gives Malmer’s values for <img style="vertical-align: -0.799ex; width: 9.723ex; height: 2.118ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nu_{K_\beta}

<p class="space-above2">
It is seen that the agreement is close, and probably within the limits
of experimental error. A comparison with the second relation is not
possible at present, and we meet also here with a difficulty arising
from the fact that Moseley observed a greater number of lines in the
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.541ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/69.svg" alt=" " data-tex="L"> radiation than should be expected on Kossel’s simple scheme<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.</p>

<p>There is another point in connexion with the above considerations
which appears to be of interest. In a recent paper W. H. Bragg<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
has shown that, in order to excite any line of the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/46.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> radiation of
an element, the frequency of the exciting radiation must be greater
than the frequency of all the lines in the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/46.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> radiation. This
result, which is in striking contrast to the ordinary phenomena of
selective absorption, can be simply explained on Kossel’s view. The
simple reverse of the process corresponding to the emission of, for
instance, <img style="vertical-align: -0.357ex; width: 3.132ex; height: 1.902ex;" src="images/67.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K_{\alpha}"> would necessitate the direct transfer of an
electron from ring 1 to ring 2, but this will obviously not be possible
unless at the beginning of the process there was a vacant place in the
latter ring. For the excitation of any line in the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/46.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> radiation,
it is therefore necessary that the electron should be completely
removed from the atom. Another consequence of Kossel’s view is that
it should be impossible to obtain the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/46.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> series of an element
without the simultaneous emission of the <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.541ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/69.svg" alt=" " data-tex="L"> series. This seems
to be in agreement with some recent experiments of C. G. Barkla<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
on the energy involved in the production of characteristic Röntgen
radiation. From these examples it will be seen that even if Kossel’s
considerations will need modification in order to account in detail for
the high frequency spectra, they seem to offer a basis for a further
development.</p>

<p>As in the <a href="#3_Spectra2">former section</a>, it is assumed that the spectra considered
above are due to the displacement of a single electron. If, however,
several electrons should happen to be removed from one of the rings
by a violent impact, the considerations at the end of the <a href="#3_Spectra2">former
section</a> would not apply, since the electrons removed in this case
can be replaced by electrons in the other rings. We might therefore
possibly expect that the rearrangement of the electrons, consequent to
the removal of more than one electron from a ring, would give rise to
spectra of still higher frequency than those considered in this section.</p>

On this view we should expect the Rydberg constant in
(13) to be not exactly the same for all elements, since the expression
(5) depends to a certain extent on the mass of the nucleus. The
correction is very small; the difference in passing from hydrogen
to an element of high atomic weight being only 0.05 per cent. (see
IV. p. 7). In a recent paper (Proc. Roy. Soc. A. xci. p. 255,
1915), Nicholson has concluded that this consequence of the theory is
inconsistent with the measurements of the ordinary helium spectrum.
It seems doubtful, however, if the measurements are accurate enough
for such a conclusion. It must be remembered that it is only for high
values of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> that the theory indicates values of <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.348ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/47.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\phi"> very
nearly unity; but for such values of <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n">,</span> the terms in question are
very small, and the relative accuracy in the experimental determination
not very high. The only spectra for which a sufficiently accurate
determination of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.011ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/46.svg" alt=" " data-tex="K"> seems possible at present are the ordinary
hydrogen spectrum and the helium spectrum considered in the <a href="#2_Spectra">former
section</a>, and in these cases the measurements agree very closely with
calculation.</p>

This value is of the same order of magnitude as the value
12.5 volts recently found by McLennan and Henderson (Proc. Roy. Soc, A.
xci. p. 485, 1915) to be the minimum voltage necessary to produce the
usual mercury spectrum. The interesting observations of single-lined
spectra of zinc and cadmium given in their paper are analogous to
Franck and Hertz’s results for mercury, and similar considerations may
therefore possibly also hold for them.</p>
